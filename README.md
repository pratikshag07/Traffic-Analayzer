# Traffic-Analyzer
Our objective of the project is to solve traffic management problems like traffic control, traffic monitoring, traffic flow, security, and so on at low cost by using camera and provide most accurate data of vehicles on roads and highways to the traffic management. In this project we have used OpenCV for image processing and Numpy libraries.
